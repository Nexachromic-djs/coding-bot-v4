Feel free to contribute.

**************************
How to self-host (Windows)
**************************
Open up command promt (type it in the search box), terminal and when you are there, use this line to clone the repo and self host:

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/The-Coding-Academy/coding-bot-v4.git; cd coding-bot-v4; . ./setup

.. code-block:: shell


It will prompt you to input your discord user id and a token for the bot. After this is finished (assuming no errors popped up, if they did they will tell you how to fix it), you can run

.. code-block:: shell

    python bot.py

to start up the bot.
